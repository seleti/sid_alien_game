Name: Siddartha Eleti

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The Specs that I implemented are:

Have implemented all the features of the Assignments.

Help at the left top - it displays all the keys that the user needs to know.

Multisprites - i have a propeller plane as a multiframe sprite.

Lsystems - For the bullets / projectiles

Multisprite Explosions- I am exploding all the UFO's on the press of the button <E>.  

Parallax scrolling - I have two backgrounds which move at different speeds. (is there in both menu and game)

Player- My multisprite can be controlled using the keys and can shoot bullets which are l-systems .

Menu - Transparent menu buttons with parallax background scrolling for better visual effect.

Sound- have nice music playing for game and the menu

Story - Included ad story page which appears before starting a new game.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Menu :

I have created a menu which has RESUME , NEW GAME, EXIT options ! 
One can move between various states i.e. from the middle of the game one can switch to the menu and do the following:
        start a new game(without having to quit and restart the game),
        resume,
        exit the game.
AI:
The enemy UFO's shoot in the direction of the player and they can be shot by the player. 

Player: 

player can move up and down while the x velocity is constant.(as a plane cannot stop in the air)

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
What i did not do :

Could not include the health feature for the player so that the player could die. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Sounds have been taken from www.sounddogs.com
Drew all my sprites except for the master UFO at the end of the world.
